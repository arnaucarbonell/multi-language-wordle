# Multi-Language Wordle (WIP)

## Overview

The **Multi-Language Wordle** is an experimental version of the popular word-guessing game **Wordle**, where players can solve daily puzzles in multiple languages. Unlike the original Wordle, which is limited to a single language, this version allows users to choose their preferred language and enjoy the challenge of guessing words in their chosen language.

Currently, the project is a **work in progress** (WIP), with many features being tested and refined. We are continuously adding new languages, improving the user interface, and expanding the functionality to create a fun and inclusive experience for Wordle fans around the world.

## Features (WIP)

- **Multiple Languages**: Players can choose from a growing list of languages to play the game in, making it more accessible to non-English speakers.
- **Word Lists**: Each language has its own set of words, so players will guess words relevant to their selected language.
- **Color Feedback System**: Similar to traditional Wordle, the game provides color-coded feedback:
  - **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter but in the wrong position.
  - **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.
- **Daily Puzzles**: Each day, a new puzzle is available to players in their chosen language.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Based on player performance, the difficulty of the word list may adapt to present a greater challenge over time.

## Languages Supported (WIP)

Currently, the following languages are supported (more are coming soon):

- **English**
- **Spanish**
- **Catalan**
